Here are some commonly used metrics for regression evaluation:\n","\n","### 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n","- **Formula**:\n","  $\n","  \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\n","  $\n","- **Description**: MAE measures the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. It is easy to interpret and provides a clear view of the average error.\n","\n","### 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n","- **Formula**:\n","  $\n","  \\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n","  $\n","- **Description**: MSE calculates the average of the squares of the errors, giving higher weight to larger errors. This metric is useful when you want to penalize larger errors more severely.\n","\n","### 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n","- **Formula**:\n","  $\n","  \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n","  $\n","- **Description**: RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides a measure of error in the same units as the target variable. It is sensitive to outliers and can be useful for understanding model performance.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Cv0V-kaZMcKK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Upgrade scikit-learn to the latest version\n","!pip install --upgrade scikit-learn"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"W-lKAGTm0bHt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728813309193,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1440,"user":{"displayName":"Cesare Montresor","userId":"02780399299495258362"}},"outputId":"eb2e555f-f9ca-4237-a2d2-9164544620ee"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: scikit-learn in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (1.5.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.19.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.26.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=1.6.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.13.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: joblib>=1.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from scikit-learn) (1.4.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: threadpoolctl>=3.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from scikit-learn) (3.5.0)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import sklearn\n","from sklearn import datasets  # Import a built-in dataset from scikit-learn\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Load the California housing dataset\n","housing_dataset = datasets.fetch_california_housing()\n","print(housing_dataset.keys())  # Print the keys of a \"housing_dataset\" object\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"j40CJuLhMbv3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728813314312,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5120,"user":{"displayName":"Cesare Montresor","userId":"02780399299495258362"}},"outputId":"9b862d62-30f6-4736-9e8a-80c46419b28a"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'frame', 'target_names', 'feature_names', 'DESCR'])\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(housing_dataset[\"DESCR\"]) #Print the description of the dataset"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"enE65i5IDnpy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727429473541,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":370,"user":{"displayName":"Cigdem Beyan","userId":"00242028384913531025"}},"outputId":"fa024cca-55f4-494e-eee4-70f7a72208ea"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":[".. _california_housing_dataset:\n","\n","California Housing dataset\n","--------------------------\n","\n","**Data Set Characteristics:**\n","\n",":Number of Instances: 20640\n","\n",":Number of Attributes: 8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target\n","\n",":Attribute Information:\n","    - MedInc        median income in block group\n","    - HouseAge      median house age in block group\n","    - AveRooms      average number of rooms per household\n","    - AveBedrms     average number of bedrooms per household\n","    - Population    block group population\n","    - AveOccup      average number of household members\n","    - Latitude      block group latitude\n","    - Longitude     block group longitude\n","\n",":Missing Attribute Values: None\n","\n","This dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository.\n","https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html\n","\n","The target variable is the median house value for California districts,\n","expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).\n","\n","This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census\n","block group.
